### Election-Audit Summary

The script is successful as it accurately provides information on each are needed for analysis as listed above. The script can be used again with slight modifications to it. For example, we can use the same unchanged script for various counties by simply changing the csv dataset or we can use the same script with slight modifications for other election audit processes such as countries and cities.
